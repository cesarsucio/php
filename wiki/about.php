            <h2>The IT KnowledgeBase</h2>
                <p>Knowledge bases are commonly used to complement a help desk. Similar to an FAQ (frequently asked questions), a knowledge base is designed to organize and present your most common customer questions or problems and an explanation of how to solve them.  A knowledge base usually stores troubleshooting information, how-to articles, user manuals, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

                <p>Typically, a search engine is used to locate information in the system, or users may browse through a custom classification scheme.</p>

                <h3>How Businesses Use The Knowledge Base</h3>

                <p>Instead of answering the same question over and over, businesses save time and money by directing customers to a online knowledge base before having them submit or open a ticket or call support directly.</p>

                <p>A knowledge base can also keep customers updated with news, announcements, release information, and product updates.</p>
