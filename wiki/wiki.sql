This has been tested on Fedora Core 8, 9 and 10, Ubuntu 8 and 9 series, OpenSUSE 10 and 11 series, and SLES 9.  It seems to work on all Kernels 2.4 and above.  It may work on lesser kernel versions, but the author has not tested this. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nSo you forgot your Linux Root account password eh?  Or maybe your company''s previous IT manager left without leaving passwords behind to your Linux server? For many users, including IT professionals, this is a common occurrence.  Rest assured,  It''s really easy to reset said password in just such a case.  This can be done by booting into single user mode (Runlevel 1). <br /><br />\r\n\r\n*Note, if you use Fedora Core 10, you may need to hold down the "shift" key on the Fedora loading screen (The one with the 3 different colors of blue loading bar) until you see the GRUB menu.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nStep 1)  If you have a graphical GRUB menu (Such as with openSUSE or Mandriva), you will want to hit the "esc" key at the boot menu.  This will prompt you with a message box saying you are leaving the graphical boot menu and starting text mode interface.  Hit OK.  Otherwise you may already be in the text mode interface.  In which case, skip to step 2.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nStep 2) Once in text mode, highlight the default boot option (you want to reset the Root password for) and hit "e" to Edit the commands before booting.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nStep 3) Highlight the line that starts with "kernel", press "e" again to edit this entry. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nStep 4) At the end of the line, type the word "single". Mine looks something like this:\r\nkernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.25.20-0 ... splash=silent showopts vga=0x314 single<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSelect all<br /><br />\r\n\r\nOpen in new window\r\nHit "enter" to save, then hit "esc" to go back to the previous screen.  <br /><br />\r\n\r\nStep 5) Still with kernel highlighted, Press "b" to boot.  Your system will boot without it''s shiny graphical boot sequence (unless the vga=xxx option is set, in which case you will have a graphical boot).  <br /><br />\r\n\r\nStep 6) If you use openSUSE, you will be presented with the following prompt:\r\nGive root password for login:<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSelect all<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\nType new password.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nOther operating systems may put you right in the command prompt with root privileges.  In which case you will need to type the following to change the root password:\r\npasswd<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSelect all<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\ntype your new password and confirm it by typing it a second time if it asks you.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIf you are using (K)Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope and in some cases, earlier versions of Ubuntu) and you follow the above steps, you may find a known bug when presented with a text menu in which you may not be able to select anything, but instead can see all your key strokes as escape characters.  In such a case you may try this work around:<br /><br />\r\n\r\nInstead of typing the word "single" as stated in step 4 above, type the following:\r\ninit=/bin/bash<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSelect all<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window<br /><br />\r\n \r\nUsing Kubuntu 9.04, mine would look like this:\r\nkernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-generic ... part2 ro quite splash vga=0x314 init=/bin/bash<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSelect all<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\nHit "enter" to save, "esc" to go back to the boot screen, and "b" to boot.  You will be presented with a prompt that looks like the following:\r\nroot@(none):/#<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSelect all<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\nOnce at the prompt, type the following:\r\nmount -t /proc\r\nmount -o remount,rw /\r\npasswd<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSelect all<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\ntype the new password   (hit enter)\r\nretype for confirmation  (hit enter)\r\nYou should now see a "password successfully changed" message.  \r\nReboot your machine and login.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nYou might ask, "Well, if it''s that easy to reset Root''s password, can''t someone reset mine?"  The answer is YES!...Never give easy physical access to a data-sensitive system!  You can password protect the GRUB boot menu, and even the BIOS to prevent people from performing these steps, but that is not covered here.<br /><br />', 9, 1, 1, 5),

Jobs are specified in a crontab (file) and are run by the cron daemon process.<br /><br />\r\n \r\nThe crontab\r\nThe crontab itself is a time table that has entries for jobs and the schedule on which these jobs need to execute. Each user on a Linux/Unix system can have a crontab. If you cannot access your crontab, an administrator (root) can grant you access.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nA sample crontab entry could look like this:\r\n00 11 * * * rm -f /var/tmp/*<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\nThe first part "00 11 * * *" is a specification of the time (or schedule) and the second part "rm -f /var/tmp/*" is the job that will be executed at that time.<br /><br />\r\n \r\nBasic commands\r\ncrontab -l\r\n  (show your crontab)<br /><br />\r\n\r\ncrontab -r\r\n  (remove your crontab - be careful)<br /><br />\r\n\r\ncrontab -e\r\n  (edit your crontab)<br /><br />\r\n \r\nHow to specify the schedule\r\nLet''s take a sample entry:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n00 11 2 * *<br /><br />\r\n\r\nMeaning:\r\n00 - minute (number 0-59)\r\n11 - hour (number 0-23)\r\n  2 - day of month (number 1-31)\r\n  * - month (number 1-12 / names allowed as well)\r\n  * - day of week (number 0-7 / 0 or 7 for sunday, names allowed as well)<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe example would mean that a job would be scheduled at 11:00 (AM) on the day 2 of every month. You can specify multiple schedules either by adding lines or by combining a comma as a separator:\r\n00,15 11 2 * *<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\nFor more details on scheduling use "man 5 crontab" on your system. For more information on tables for driving cron jobs, see this very clear description.<br /><br />\r\n \r\nHow to specify the job\r\nYou can specify the job (program, script or commands) by adding it directly behind the schedule:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n00 11 * * * rm -f /var/tmp/*\r\n  (one command)<br /><br />\r\n\r\n00 11 * * * rm -f /var/tmp/* && touch /var/tmp/cleanup_done\r\n  (more commands)<br /><br />\r\n\r\n00 11 * * * /home/username/cronscript.sh\r\n  (a script on your homedirectory)<br /><br />\r\n\r\nNote: cron does not know of any environment settings you may have setup in your profile. So if you would have ${ORACLE_HOME} in your PATH and you type sqlplus to start the sqlplus application, this will not work in a script that is started by cron. You either have to specify a full path to each command in your script, set the path first or call your environment script.<br /><br />\r\n \r\nA real example\r\nIn this example, I want to know the status of the power supply of a banana pi device that I have. The details of the power supply can be shown by looking at a special device (uevent).<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThis is the (root) crontab entry:\r\n*/5 * * * * /root/pwr<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\n(note the special /5 at the minute field which means every 5 minutes, so 0,5,10,15 etc.)<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe pwr script that is being called here looks like this:<br /><br />\r\n\r\necho $(date) >> /root/pwr.txt\r\ncat /sys/devices/platform/sunxi-i2c.0/i2c-0/0-0034/axp20-supplyer.28/power_supply/ac/uevent >> /root/pwr.txt<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\nThe script is echoing the current date/time and adding the output of the cat ... uevent to the pwr.txt file.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe last lines of the pwr.txt file:\r\nSun Feb 15 23:25:02 CET 2015\r\nPOWER_SUPPLY_NAME=ac\r\nPOWER_SUPPLY_MODEL_NAME=ac\r\nPOWER_SUPPLY_PRESENT=1\r\nPOWER_SUPPLY_ONLINE=1\r\nPOWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_NOW=4846000\r\nPOWER_SUPPLY_CURRENT_NOW=313000<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\nWhere I can see that the pwr script ran at 23:25 and that the supply voltage is 4846000mV (4.8V) and the device is using 313000uA (313mA) so about 1.5W.<br /><br />\r\n \r\nSome best practices\r\nRedirecting output of your job\r\nIf you want to know if your crontab is generating output, redirect std error and std output by adding this at the end of your crontab line:\r\n2>&1 >> /home/username/cronscript.log<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window<br /><br />\r\n\r\nHowto check if you job did run (or not)\r\nWhen you want to know whether a crontab job ran, you can add a touch command after the command like this:\r\n&& touch /home/username/cronscript.lastrun<br /><br />\r\n \r\nOpen in new window\r\nWhen you look at the file cronscript.lastrun, look at its timestamp to know the last time it ran. If you get no file, it did not run at all<br /><br />\r\n\r\nTemporary disabling\r\nTo disable one crontab job, edit your crontab using crontab -e and put a # (hash) in front of the line you want to disable.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nTo disable the whole crontab, first save your crontab entries using crontab -l > saved_crontab and then remove it using crontab -r If you want to enable it again use crontab saved_crontab<br /><br />', 9, 1, 1, 5),

With the help of Outlook, you can maintain your address book, store information about your contacts, and keep track of your meetings and appointments.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nMS Outlook has been used in many organizations to store information about their employees to have immediate contact with them. This contact information is stored in the address book. Contacts in MS Outlook can be considered as a business card. MS Outlook uses these contact information for sending email, faxes, placing phone calls, arranging meetings etc.  Sometimes a need arises to share this contacts information with other program or applications like Gmail, mobile phone application etc. At this time, you have to export these contact information into vCard format because this format is acceptable by most of the application, programs or devices.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nMS Outlook has the capability to export contacts into a vCard format.  Steps to export MS Outlook 2010 contacts into vCard format are shown below: <br /><br />\r\n\r\nStep 1: open MS Outlook and Select contacts folder from the navigation pane.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nScreenshot-9.png\r\nStep 2: Select the contact that you want to export as vCard.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nScreenshot-10.png\r\nStep 3: Click file tab and choose save as option.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nScreenshot-11.png\r\nStep 4: Navigate to the folder where you want to save the vCard file.

This process consumes more time when there is large number of contacts are available.\r\nMethods like forwarding contacts as attachment of email and then dragging –dropping vCard from attachments, provide an indirect way to export multiple or all contacts to the vCard file. This will also consume more time when your contacts are in large number and saved in the different folder structure.\r\nOne more limitation of dragging and dropping is that the contacts from email attachment create multiple vCard files i.e all contacts are not exported to a single vCard file.\r\nMost technically sound people suggest that for having all contacts into a single vCard file you should first export all contacts into the .csv format. Then import .csv file to Gmail and from Gmail you will be able to export all contacts into a single vCard file. This method is very lengthy and not a used to method. Also, the vCard file so obtained is not so accurate in respect of information’s.<br /><br />\r\n \r\nFor exporting large number of contacts into a single vCard file that contain all information about contacts with the full accuracy you can use vCard magic.

This article explains how to correct this serious omission by the folks in Redmond and install (for free!) Microsoft Office Picture Manager 2010, which plays nicely with Office 2013.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to install Picture Manager from the media of your prior Office version, such as 2007 or 2010. But you''ll need to look at the license agreement to determine if that is in compliance. Since there are several Office versions that contain Picture Manager and numerous Microsoft license agreements, I cannot give any advice on the legality of this approach — you must check your particular license agreement. That said, this article discusses a different approach that is definitely in license compliance.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, Picture Manager is a component of SharePoint Designer 2010, which is available as a free download at the Microsoft site:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n32-bit\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16573<br /><br />\r\n\r\n64-bit\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24309<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Picture Manager is not a component of SharePoint Designer 2013 — another serious omission by the Redmond folks.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nOn the license compliance issue, the key term in the SharePoint Designer 2010 license agreement is this:\r\n1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices.\r\nThere are, of course, other terms, and you should read them carefully (the entire license agreement, via a copy/paste from the installation dialog, is attached to this article). But upon accepting the license agreement, your installation of Picture Manager will be in license compliance.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nAfter downloading the correct version for your environment (32-bit or 64-bit), run the SharePoint Designer 2010 setup program. If you downloaded the wrong version, you will see something like this Setup Error dialog:<br /><br />\r\n\r\nWrong version\r\nWith the right version, you will get this (all of the subsequent screenshots in this article are from a W7/64-bit system using the SharePoint Designer 2010 64-bit install):<br /><br />\r\n\r\nCustomize install\r\nClick on the Customize installation button. Then in the Installation Options tab, click the drop-down arrow in all three main areas under Microsoft Office and select Not Available. You will then have this:<br /><br />\r\n\r\nDeselect everything\r\nExpand Office Tools by clicking the plus sign and you will see the Microsoft Office Picture Manager. This is the one-and-only component that needs to be installed from the SharePoint Designer 2010 setup. Click the drop-down arrow of Microsoft Office Picture Manager and select Run from My Computer. The red X will disappear and it will look like this:<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSelect Picture Manager\r\nClick the Install Now button. You should then see this installation completed dialog:<br /><br />\r\n\r\nInstallation completed\r\nNow check your program groups and you will find a new Microsoft Office group next to your Microsoft Office 2013 group:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice program group\r\nThe new Microsoft Office group has a shortcut to Microsoft Office Picture Manager, which works perfectly alongside your Office 2013 applications:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\nPicture Manager 2010 working with Office 2013\r\nEnjoy having Picture Manager back again!<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIf you find this article to be helpful, please click the big green Vote this article as helpful button below.

There are situations, though, where you have limited hardware or infrastructure that is serving multiple purposes and installing IIS on a cluster is your only option.   <br /><br />\r\n\r\nIf you do find yourself in this predicament and have to configure IIS on a cluster, the good news is that the process is actually fairly straight-forward.  Since the focus of this article is the setup of IIS on clustered servers, I''m going to leave out all of the Microsoft Cluster Services (MSCS) specifics, assuming you already have the cluster created along with the appropriate disk group and virtual IP resources.  However, if you need help with that part, the following TechNet article "How to Create a Windows Server 2003 Failover Cluster for Cluster Continuous Replication" should help to point you in the right direction.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\nHere''s what you do to configure IIS on an active/passive MSCS cluster:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n Install IIS to a local drive on each node of your cluster.\r\n Create a folder on the clustered data drive to hold the website content. \r\n If you are going to create a new site to use other than Default Web, verify that the Default Website is either stopped or bound to a local IP on Node A.  Then create a website on Node A and bind it to All Unassigned. \r\n Point the home directory of your website to the folder you created above. \r\n Create or place a test page in the home directory and verify it comes up.\r\n Fail cluster resources over to Node B and create the website over there, pointing to the same home directory and IP as all unassigned.\r\n Fail back over to Node A.  In Cluster Admin right-click the cluster group name and select New Resource.  \r\n   »» Name it IIS Resource\r\n   »» Select Generic Script for the resource type\r\n   »» Verify both nodes are selected as possible owners\r\n   »» Select the data disk, IP Address, and Name as dependencies\r\n   »» Point to c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\clusweb.vbs for the script parameter\r\n   »» Finish\r\n Right-click IIS Resource and then select Bring Online.\r\n Now right-click IIS Resource and select Initiate Failure 3 times in a row.  Resources should fail over to Node B.\r\n Verify the website comes up on Node B, and then move the resources back to Node A.\r\n Configure DNS for your new website so that it points to the cluster''s IP address.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nI specifically created this article for IIS 6 (and not 7) for a couple of reasons.  First, that''s the only version I''ve attempted to cluster.  Second, Microsoft''s support for clustering on IIS 7 is sketchy at best.  Initially when 2008 Server was released, Microsoft announced that they were completely ditching support for clustering IIS.  This made sense to most of us, until they shipped Clusweb and Clusftp vbs files as part of Windows 2008.  Those are the same script files that were used to cluster IIS 5.0 and 6.0, so including them seemed a little odd since they were no longer part of a supported configuration.  To confuse the issue even further, in just the last few months, Microsoft has backtracked on their earlier statements and they now support clustering IIS 7 - without using the Clusweb or Clusftp files, which apparently were shipped with the OS by mistake. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nBottom line - IIS is a platform, not an application, and therefore is not very well suited for clustering.  NLB or hardware load balancing should be your first choice, but know that it is possible to cluster IIS if you have no other choice.<br /><br />', 12, 1, 1, 3);
